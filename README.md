## Sticky Scroll Sidebar

[View example](https://anemptyblissbeyondthisworld.neocities.org/layouts/Sticky-Scroll-Sidebar/template-sticky-scroll-sidebar)

* Sidebar + main content
* Mobile Responsive
* Sidebar is sticky as you scroll on desktop
* correctly set up so position: sticky works
* Sidebar wraps and is not sticky on mobile
* Uses media queries; which is a concession, I'd like to learn how to remove those and do it automatically!
* No aesthetic content: just functionality. User can then add their preferred styling.
* Option in the code for either narrow sidebar + big main content, or a more 50/50 division as [in this example](http://fencraft.leprd.space/Symbols/sym-pillarstar.html).
