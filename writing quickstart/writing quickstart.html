                <ul>
                    <li>Text-focus</li>
                    <li>Booklike & inspired by traditional typography</li>
                    <li>Easy on the eyes</li>
                    <li>Earthy, elven and organic</li>
                    <li>Slam it on some text when you just want to put up your essay and not think about aesthetics</li>

                <h2>Fonts Used</h2>
                <p>The CSS for this page links to your local downloads of</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Source Serif Pro (body)</li>
                    <li>Macondo Swash Caps (main header)</li>
                    <li>Headland One (all other headers)</li>
                    <li>Libre Baskeville (quotes)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The setup is quick for me because I already have those fonts downloaded! <a href="http://fencraft.leprd.space/Beginners/What%20Is%20Basic.html">See it in context.</a></p>

                <p>You can replicate this look by downloading the fonts from <a href="https://gwfh.mranftl.com/">The Google Webfonts Helper</a> - or replace them with google webfonts code. And of course, swap out the fonts for your own</p>

                <h2>Summer</h2>

                <p>Summer is my favourite time of year. Here's a quote from <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite></p>

                <blockquote>
                    “And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.” 
                </blockquote>

                <p>The Great Gatsby is what we call <q>a book</q>. This <q>fancy quotes</q> functionality puts in elegant curly quotation marks, which look nicer than 'the standard ones' you get while typing.</p>

                <p>I've bundled in the code from <a href="http://boundedinfinity.github.io/2017/09/admonitions-in-css/">Bounded Infinity</a> for some nice admonition boxes, but adjusted the CSS so it uses fewer classes and more human-readable, intuitive HTML</p>
